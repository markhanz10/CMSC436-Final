   We started with the first deadline for this project and have not started working yet on all the features. So far Matt worked 
   hard on the write up and we all have a good idea on what features and implementations we are going to need to do for the
   final version of this project. Joel worked on getting the skeleton code completed so now we have everything we need to really
   get started. For the future, we know have a plan and a schedule on when we are going to work as a team, and can figure out a plan
   to divide up future tasks when they come up.
